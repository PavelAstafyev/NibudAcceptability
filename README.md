# NibudAcceptability

In this repo, I make available

- the materials needed to reproduce my experiment on the acceptability of Russian _nibud'_ indefinites (including stimuli, instruction, and code intended to be deployed to <a href="https://farm.pcibex.net/">PCIbex Farm</a>) and 

- the extracted participant's judgments + the R notebook with the statistical analysis (unfortunately, I cannot make the raw file generated by PCIbex public because it contains the participants' personal info).
